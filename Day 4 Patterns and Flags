# Patterns and Flags
A regular expression (also “regexp”, or just “reg”) consists of a pattern and optional flags.

There are two syntaxes to create a regular expression object.

The long syntax:

regexp = new RegExp("pattern", "flags");

…And the short one, using slashes "/":

regexp = /pattern/; // no flags
regexp = /pattern/gmi; // with flags g,m and i (to be covered soon)

Slashes "/" tell JavaScript that we are creating a regular expression. They play the same role as quotes for strings.
