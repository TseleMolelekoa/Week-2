File and FileReader.
File and FileReader are part of the File API, which provides a way to interact with files asynchronously. 
File Object:
The File object represents a file on the user's computer or a file reference that may be created programmatically. It is typically obtained from an input element of type "file" in an HTML form or through drag and drop operations.

Properties of the File Object:
name: The name of the file.
size: The size of the file in bytes.
type: The MIME type of the file.
lastModified: A timestamp representing the last modified time of the file.
Example of creating a File object: const file = new File(["Hello, World!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });

FileReader Object:
The FileReader object allows you to read the contents of a File or a Blob asynchronously. It provides several methods for reading different types of data, such as text or binary data, from a file.

Methods of the FileReader Object:
readAsText(file, encoding): Reads the contents of the specified File or Blob as text.
readAsDataURL(file): Reads the contents of the specified File or Blob as a data URL.
readAsArrayBuffer(file): Reads the contents of the specified File or Blob as an ArrayBuffer.
readAsBinaryString(file): Reads the contents of the specified File or Blob as a binary string (deprecated).
abort(): Aborts the read operation.
